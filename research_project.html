        <div class="research-item">
            <h2>Title: Secondary Students’ Facial Emotional Expressions during Class</h2>
            <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> This study aims to investigate whether there is any correlation between students’ facial and self-reported emotions. Also, how teachers’ emotions and behaviors are related to students’ facial and self-reported emotions.</p>
            <p><strong>Sample:</strong> 150 participants from German secondary schools</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> It is evident from the result that there is a significant positive correlation between students’ facial and reported joy. Also, there is a significant correlation between teachers’ responses and students’ facial joy.</p>

        <!-- Research Project 2 -->
        <div class="research-item">
            <h2>Title: Learning Analytics: Sequence of Questions during Medical History Taking</h2>
            <p><strong>Research Questions:</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li>To examine the role of questioning items in diagnosing accuracy.</li>
                    <li>To analyze whether some questions have better predictive power than others.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sample:</strong> 143 medical students took part in the study.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Machine learning models predicted 9 accurately out of 11 predictions with an accuracy of 82%. The findings indicate that the questioning pattern plays a crucial role in arriving at the correct conclusion in diagnostic simulations.</p>

        <div class="research-item">
            <h2>Title: Interest and Effort in Mathematics Affect Math Achievement</h2>
            <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of interest and effort on math achievement.</p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Interest and effort predict math achievement at the concurrent level.</p>
            <p><strong>Sample:</strong> Data were collected from 1,501 students from grades 5 to 10.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> The result showed that interest significantly predicted math achievement, and in later stages, it continued to impact math achievement positively.</p>

        <div class="research-item">
            <h2>Title: The Interrelatedness between Teacher Enjoyment and Teacher-Class Relationship Quality: A Cross-lagged Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> This study investigated the causal relationship between teacher enjoyment and teacher-student relationship quality over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Teacher enjoyment and teacher-student relationship quality are positively reciprocally linked over measurement times.</p>
            <p><strong>Participants:</strong> Data were obtained from 93 teachers.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> The study showed positive and significant correlations between teacher enjoyment and the teacher-class relationship, especially from T2 to T3. Contrary to the hypothesis, a clear dominance of one cross-lagged path was evident.</p>
